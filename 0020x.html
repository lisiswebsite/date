    <p>You push the emergency button without him noticing and the elevator stops suddenly.
        You both introduce yourselves to break the awkward silence, which starts a longer conversation.
        <!-- insert dialogue and ad about pratt baseball -->
        You find out that he's a baseball player at Pratt.
        Over the next few hours while you wait for the elevator to start moving again, you fall in love.
        He tells you that once the two of you get out of here, he wants to take you on a proper date.
        Unfortunately, you never get rescued and you both die of starvation in the elevator.
        <br>GAME OVER
